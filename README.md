# modular-aspect-container
An example of a multi module use of AspectJ 

This project is based on instructions found here:
http://www.mojohaus.org/aspectj-maven-plugin/multimodule/multimodule_strategy.html

I only renamed the module names to understand better what they are for and i added a JUnit test inside the project aspect.test
